# Weather Forecast Application Development

This project is a weather forecasting web application that allows users to search for weather forecasts by city name or current location. It provides a simple and intuitive user interface and supports extended forecasts, location-based search, and a dropdown for recently searched cities. The project also handles API errors gracefully, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Features

-> Users can search for weather forecasts by their current location.
-> A dropdown menu allows users to select from recently searched cities. The dropdown updates dynamically and 
   stores data in local or session storage.
-> Users can view extended forecasts for the next 5 days.
-> The application handles API errors and provides a user-friendly error message.
-> The app uses appropriate icons to represent different weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
-> The UI is responsive and works well on various screen sizes, including desktop, iPad Mini, and iPhone SE.
